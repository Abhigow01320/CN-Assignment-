1. Instruction to run the program:


Program takes 3 arguments 
Two IP Adresses and a subnet value and returns "Same subnet" if two IPs belong to same subnet, "Different subnet" if not.

2. Example inputs


1. 10.20.30.40  10.20.33.40  18
2. 10.20.30.40  10.20.33.40  21


3. Challenges faced:

Spliting the input ip and converting that to binary was quite difficult, so we took help from the internet(stack overflow). This made the code shorter than ours.
